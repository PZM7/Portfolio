        <p>Hi! I'm Pedro Zahonero Mangas a junior Software Engineering. I just finished my university studies at the University of Oviedo.<br>Throughout my training I have strengthened my spirit of teamwork, initiative and involvement in tasks, as well as my knowledge of languages like Italian, through a Erasmus experience in Italy, or English thanks to intensive courses.
        <br>Without having any work experience I come with a desire to work, keep learning about software engineering and climb in my carreer as a computer scientist. The way I like to work the most is as a frontend developer but there is no problem if I have to do some backend work. I consider myself a very calm and ambitious person but sometimes a bit lazy. I always try to improve, both personally and at work, and any improvement comments are always welcome.</p>
